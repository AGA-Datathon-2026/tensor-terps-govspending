## Short Abstract of the Project
This project promotes financial literacy by transforming complex U.S. federal spending data into clear, interactive dashboards. Using the USAspending.gov API, we structured spending data by year, agency, award type, and state, then built Tableau visualizations so non-technical users can explore where government money goes, how spending changes over time, and which agencies/states account for the largest shares.
